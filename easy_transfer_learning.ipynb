    "# Easy transfer learning with 🐸 STT ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to train a Coqui (🐸) STT model, but you don't have a lot of data. What do you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer 💡: Grab a pre-trained model and fine-tune it to your data. This is called `\"Transfer Learning\"` ⚡\n",
    "\n",
    "🐸 STT comes with transfer learning support out-of-the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it to _any new language_, even if the alphabets are completely different. Likewise, you can fine-tune a model to your own data and improve performance if the language is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download a pre-trained English STT model.\n",
    "2. Download data for the Russian language.\n",
    "3. Fine-tune the English model to Russian language.\n",
    "4. Test the new Russian model and display its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's jump right in!\n",
    "\n",
    "*PS - If you just want a working, off-the-shelf model, check out the [🐸 Model Zoo](https://www.coqui.ai/models)*"

    "You must **always** configure the paths to your data, and you must **always** configure your alphabet. For transfer learning, it's good practice to define different `load_checkpoint_dir` and `save_checkpoint_dir` paths so that you keep your new model (Russian STT) separate from the old one (English STT). The parameter `drop_source_layers` allows you to remove layers from the original (aka \"source\") model, and re-initialize them from scratch. If you are fine-tuning to a new alphabet you will have to use _at least_ `drop_source_layers=1` to remove the output layer and add a new output layer which matches your new alphabet.\n",
